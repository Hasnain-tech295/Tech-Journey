Q1. Explain the concept of Karma in under 100 words for a 12-year-old. <br>
    In this prompt I learnt about "Zero Shot Prompting", I didn't provide any example or context but just a simple straight forward prompt right. 
    Although I didn't provide output format but the output size and we define audience as well.
    
# LLM Response <br>
Karma means "what goes around comes around." It’s the idea that if you do good things—like helping others or being kind—good things will happen to you later. But if you do bad things—like lying or hurting someone—bad things might come your way. It’s like planting seeds: if you plant apple seeds, you get apples. Karma teaches us that our actions matter, and they can shape our future.



Q2. Is 737 a prime number? Think step-by-step.
    In this prompt I learnt about "Chain-of-thought prompting", I asked LLM to think every single single step like an iteration - first iteration at a time right. <br>

Let's determine whether **737** is a prime number by going step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what a prime number is**

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than **1 and itself**.

So, to check if **737** is a prime number, we need to see whether it has **any divisors other than 1 and 737**.

---

### **Step 2: Check divisibility by small prime numbers**

We'll test small prime numbers to see if any of them divide 737 evenly.

**Is 737 divisible by 2?**
No, because it’s odd.

**Is 737 divisible by 3?**
Sum of digits: 7 + 3 + 7 = 17 → not divisible by 3 → **No**.

**Is 737 divisible by 5?**
It doesn't end in 0 or 5 → **No**.

**Is 737 divisible by 7?**
Let's try:
737 ÷ 7 = 105.29 → **No** (not a whole number).

**Is 737 divisible by 11?**
Alternating sum of digits: 7 - 3 + 7 = 11 → **Yes!**

So **737 is divisible by 11**.

Let’s do the division:
737 ÷ 11 = **67**

---

### **Step 3: Check if the factors are prime**

We found:

$$
737 = 11 \times 67
$$

Now, is 67 a prime number?

* 67 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.
* √67 ≈ 8.2, so we only need to check primes ≤ 8.
* None of those divide 67 → **67 is prime**

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**:

**737 is not a prime number** because:

$$
737 = 11 \times 67
$$

and both **11** and **67** are prime numbers. So **737 is a composite number**.
