# What is Prompt Engineering? Why it's a Superpower in AI
Prompt Engineering is a skill of writing inputs in "Natural Language" to LLMs like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude etc. that produce specific, accurate(although LLM can make mistakes and hallucinate but most of the time it provide good result) and High Quality result. <br>
<br>**In my words** - It is just a way to talk to LLM Models right. The better we explain our requirement to LLMs, the better it will respond as simple as that or we can say it is a language which connect Humans and LLM models or simply AI. <br>

**Prompt = Command Spell** <br>
**LLM = Magic Engine**<br>
**You/Me = Prompt Wizard**<br>

Prompt Engineering is not just about asking questions and getting response, It's an art of :<br>
- Structured instruction clearly
- providing the right context
- choosing the right format
- controlling tone, output type, persona, reasoning.<br>

**Types**
1. Zero shot - asking question without any example
2. Few shot  - provide few examples
3. Chain of thought - asking the model to think step by step
4. React Style - Reasoning + Act (simultaneously) used especially in agents and Agent Based AI <br>
