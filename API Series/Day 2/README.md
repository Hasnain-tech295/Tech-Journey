# Today's Goal: HTTP requests - the building block of how API works
**HTTP** - Foundation of data communication across web or internet. Think of it like ordering food:<br>
 I(client) make a request  -  Server(Restaurant) waiter/kitchen recieve the request<br>
 I specify details     -    server gives result

## HTTP methods :
1. GET : Fetch Data from API
2. POST : Send new Data to API
3. PUT : Update existing data
4. DELETE : Remove data

## Status Code : Tells whether API calls worked/passed or failed
There are many status code (numeric code) but most common one are:
1. 200 : OK
2. 201 : Created
3. 404 : Not Found


**Today I cover only GET and POST**
